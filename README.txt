NexGen Binary regenerated v3 package

IMPORTANT:
- Upload all files/folders to the SAME folder that your live site currently serves from.
  If your current live site uses /src (React/Vite), this static package will NOT override it.
  For GitHub Pages static hosting, put these files at repo root (or /docs if Pages is set to /docs).

- GA tag ID: G-XXXXXXXXXX

- GBP URL: https://www.google.com/maps?cid=REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_GBP_ID
