NexGen Binary Static Replacement Package (GitHub Pages)

WHY THE CHANGES DID NOT SHOW
- Your repo is an Astro project and includes a GitHub Actions workflow (.github/workflows/astro.yml).
- That workflow builds and deploys the Astro site (usually from src/ + public/ to dist/).
- Raw HTML files uploaded to repo root do NOT replace the Astro-generated site unless you switch deployment method.

RECOMMENDED CLEAN RESET (Static site route)
1) In GitHub: Settings > Pages
   - Change Source to: Deploy from a branch
   - Branch: main
   - Folder: /(root)

2) Delete these Astro/build folders/files from the repo (they are not needed for the static package):
   FOLDERS TO REMOVE:
   - .astro/
   - .github/           (or at least .github/workflows/astro.yml)
   - dist/
   - node_modules/
   - public/
   - src/

   FILES TO REMOVE:
   - astro.config.mjs
   - package.json
   - package-lock.json
   - tsconfig.json
   - PATCH-contact-formEndpoint.json (optional; keep only if you need it)
   - Any old duplicate site files if present

3) Upload ALL files from this package into the repo root (same level as index.html)

4) Commit and hard refresh the site (Ctrl+F5)

PLACEHOLDERS TO UPDATE BEFORE GO-LIVE
- G-XXXXXXXXXX (Google Analytics / gtag)
- Phone number and tel link
- Google Business Profile URL
- Formspree form endpoints
- example.com URLs in sitemap/robots/schema

ALTERNATIVE (Keep Astro)
- If you want to keep Astro, this package must be converted into src/pages/*.astro and public assets.
- Ask for an “Astro-native conversion package” and I can generate that version.
